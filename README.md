# LangChain Project

## Description

This project provides a setup for developing applications using LangChain, a powerful framework for building applications with large language models (LLMs). It includes a Python 3.10 environment managed by Conda and the core LangChain dependency.

## Prerequisites

- Conda (Miniconda or Anaconda)
- macOS (osx-arm64 platform)

## Installation

1. Create a new Conda environment with Python 3.10:

   ```
   conda create -p venv python==3.10 -y
   ```

2. Activate the environment:

   ```
   conda activate venv/
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Dependencies

- langchain: The core framework for building LLM applications.

## Notes

- **Channel Warning**: You may see warnings about adding 'defaults' to the channel list implicitly. To resolve this, explicitly add channels using `conda config --add channels <name>`, e.g., `conda config --add channels defaults`.
- **Typo in Command**: The initial command had a typo (`pythong==3.10` instead of `python==3.10`), which caused a PackagesNotFoundError. Ensure correct spelling when creating environments.
- The environment is created in the project directory at `./venv`.

## Usage

Add your LangChain code here. For example:

```python
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
# Your code here
```
