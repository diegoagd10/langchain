Numerous\\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional\\ncomputation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2 Background\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 12]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\\n3 Model Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., xn) to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z = (z1, ..., zn). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1, ..., ym) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\n2'),\n",

Each layer has two\\nsub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\\nwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of\\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [ 1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\\nLayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer\\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.\\nDecoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6identical layers. In addition to the two\\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\\npredictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\\n3.2 Attention\\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors.

We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QKT\\n√dk\\n)V (1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\\nof 1√dk\\n. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of\\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\\nextremely small gradients 4.

For each of these we use\\ndk = dv = dmodel/h = 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[38, 2, 9].\\n• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN(x) = max(0, xW1 + b1)W2 + b2 (2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff = 2048.\\n3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √dmodel.\\n5'),\n",

To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\nbottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\\nas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\\nlearned and fixed [9].\\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\\nP E(pos,2i) = sin(pos/100002i/dmodel )\\nP E(pos,2i+1) = cos(pos/100002i/dmodel )\\nwhere pos is the position and i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2π to 10000 · 2π. We\\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\\nrelative positions, since for any fixed offset k, P Epos+k can be represented as a linear function of\\nP Epos.\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two\\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4 Why Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1, ..., xn) to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., zn), with xi, zi ∈ Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations.

Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [ 3], which has a shared source-\\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\\nvocabulary [38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\\ntarget tokens.\\n5.2 Hardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the\\nbottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps\\n(3.5 days).\\n5.3 Optimizer\\nWe used the Adam optimizer [20] with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.98 and ϵ = 10−9.

The configuration of this model is\\nlisted in the bottom line of Table 3. Training took 3.5 days on 8 P100 GPUs. Even our base model\\nsurpasses all previously published models and ensembles, at a fraction of the training cost of any of\\nthe competitive models.\\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our big model achieves a BLEU score of 41.0,\\noutperforming all of the previously published single models, at less than 1/4 the training cost of the\\nprevious state-of-the-art model. The Transformer (big) model trained for English-to-French used\\ndropout rate Pdrop = 0.1, instead of 0.3.\\nFor the base models, we used a single model obtained by averaging the last 5 checkpoints, which\\nwere written at 10-minute intervals. For the big models, we averaged the last 20 checkpoints. We\\nused beam search with a beam size of 4 and length penalty α = 0.6 [38]. These hyperparameters\\nwere chosen after experimentation on the development set. We set the maximum output length during\\ninference to input length + 50, but terminate early when possible [38].\\nTable 2 summarizes our results and compares our translation quality and training costs to other model\\narchitectures from the literature. We estimate the number of floating point operations used to train a\\nmodel by multiplying the training time, the number of GPUs used, and an estimate of the sustained\\nsingle-precision floating-point capacity of each GPU 5.\\n6.2 Model Variations\\nTo evaluate the importance of different components of the Transformer, we varied our base model\\nin different ways, measuring the change in performance on English-to-German translation on the\\n5We used values of 2.8, 3.7, 6.0 and 9.5 TFLOPS for K80, K40, M40 and P100, respectively.\\n8'),\n",

On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014\\nEnglish-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best\\nmodel outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We\\nplan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and\\nto investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs\\nsuch as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/\\ntensorflow/tensor2tensor.\\nAcknowledgements We are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for their fruitful\\ncomments, corrections and inspiration.\\nReferences\\n[1] Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

Players control the special agent Leon S. Kennedy on a mission to rescue the president of the United States\\'s daughter, Ashley Graham, who has been kidnapped by a religious cult in rural Spain. Leon fights hordes of enemies infected by a mind-controlling parasite and reunites with the spy and mercenary Ada Wong. In a departure from the fixed camera angles and slower gameplay of previous Resident Evil games, Resident Evil 4 features a dynamic camera system and action-oriented gameplay.\\nDevelopment on Resident Evil 4 began for the PlayStation 2 in 1999. Four proposed versions were discarded; the first was directed by Hideki Kamiya, but series creator Shinji Mikami felt it was too great a departure from the previous games, so it was spun off as Devil May Cry (2001). Other versions were scrapped until Mikami took directorial duties for what became the final version. The game was announced as part of the Capcom Five, a collaboration between Capcom and Nintendo to create five exclusives for the GameCube.\\nResident Evil 4 garnered acclaim for its story, gameplay, graphics, voice acting, and characters, and is cited as one of the best video games of all time, winning multiple Game of the Year awards in 2005. It was ported to numerous formats, and became a multi-platform hit, selling 14.7 million copies by March 2025. It influenced the evolution of the survival horror and third-person genres, popularizing the \"over-the-shoulder\" third-person view used in games such as Gears of War, Dead Space, and The Last of Us. Resident Evil 5 was released in 2009 and a remake of Resident Evil 4 was released in 2023.[1]\\n\\n\\nGameplay[edit]\\nThe player controls the protagonist, Leon S. Kennedy, from a third-person perspective. Departing significantly from the series\\' previous games, the gameplay focuses on action and shootouts with fewer survival horror elements. The camera is placed behind Leon and zooms in for an over-the-shoulder view when aiming a weapon, or a first-person view when aiming with a sniper rifle.[2] There is no crosshair for firearms; instead, every firearm has a laser sight. Unlike previous games where players can only shoot straight, up, or down, players have more options. For example, shots to the feet can cause enemies to stumble, and shots to the arms can make them drop their weapons. Players can also shoot down projectiles like thrown axes or scythes.[3]\\n\\nLeon fighting a group of Ganados. Unlike previous entries in the series, Resident Evil 4 has the camera following directly behind the character. The laser sight enables the player to target key zones on enemies.[3]\\nResident Evil 4 adds context-sensitive controls. Based on the situation, players can interact with the environment: kicking down a ladder, jumping out of a window, dodging an attack or executing a \"finishing move\" on weakened enemies. There are also quick time events, in which the player must press buttons indicated on-screen to execute actions such as dodging a falling boulder or wrestling an enemy to stay alive. These are often incorporated into the game\\'s many boss fights, in which the player must avoid instant-kill attacks.[4]\\nThe main enemies are violent villagers referred to as Los Ganados (\"The Cattle\" in Spanish). They can dodge, wield melee and projectile weapons, and are capable of working collectively and communicating with each other. Once simple farmers until becoming the product of an infestation of Las Plagas (\"The Plague\" in Spanish), Los Ganados can gain the ability to cause mutated parasites to sprout from their heads.[5]\\nThe inventory system features a grid system, represented by an attaché case, that has each item take up a certain number of spaces. The case can be upgraded several times, allowing for more space. Weapons, ammunition, and healing items are kept in the case, while key items and treasures are kept in a separate menu. Items may be bought from and sold to a merchant that appears in various locations. He sells first aid sprays, weapons, allows for weapons to be upgraded and buys various treasures that Leon finds. The various weapons each have their own advantages and disadvantages.[6][7]\\nCapcom added content for the PlayStation 2 version, which was later incorporated into the PC and Wii releases. The largest addition is \"Separate Ways\", a side story which focuses on Ada Wong\\'s involvement in Resident Evil 4 and her connection to the series\\' villain Albert Wesker.[8] \"Ada\\'s Report\", a five-part documentary, analyzes Ada\\'s relationship with Wesker and his role in the plot.[9] Other unlockable content in all versions includes the minigame \"The Mercenaries\" and short scenario \"Assignment Ada\" (using Ada to retrieve Las Plagas samples), new costumes for Leon and Ashley, new weapons, and a cutscene browser.[10]\\n\\nPlot[edit]\\nIn 2004, U.S. government agent Leon S. Kennedy (Paul Mercier) is on a mission to rescue Ashley Graham (Carolyn Lawrence), the U.S. President\\'s daughter, who has been abducted by a mysterious cult.[11] He travels to an unnamed rural village in Spain,[12] where he encounters a group of hostile villagers who pledge their lives to Los Iluminados, the cult that kidnapped Ashley. The villagers were once simple farmers until becoming infected by a mind-controlling parasite known as Las Plagas.[13]\\nWhile in the village, Leon is captured by its chief, Bitores Mendez, and injected with Las Plagas.[14] He finds himself held captive with Luis Sera (Rino Romano), a former police officer in Madrid, and former Los Iluminados researcher.[15] The two work together to escape, but soon go their separate ways. Leon finds out Ashley is being held in a church and rescues her.[16] They both escape from the church after Osmund Saddler (Michael Gough), leader of the cult, reveals his plan to use the parasite they injected into Ashley to manipulate her into injecting the president of the United States with a \"sample\" once she returns home, allowing Saddler to begin his conquest of the world.[17]\\nAfter killing Mendez, Leon and Ashley try to take refuge in a castle but are attacked by more Iluminados under the command of Ramon Salazar (Rene Mujica), another of Saddler\\'s henchmen who owns the castle,[14] and the two become separated by Salazar\\'s traps. Meanwhile, Luis searches for pills that will slow Leon and Ashley\\'s infection, as well as a sample of Las Plagas. He brings the two items to Leon but is killed by Saddler, who takes the sample, while the pills to suppress the infection remain in Leon\\'s hands.[18] While in the castle, Leon briefly encounters Ada Wong (Sally Cahill), a woman from his past who supports him during his mission. He battles his way through the castle before killing Salazar.[19]\\nAfterward, Leon travels to a nearby island research facility, where he continues the search for Ashley. He discovers that one of his former training comrades, Jack Krauser (Jim Ward), who was believed to have been killed in a helicopter crash two years prior, is responsible for her kidnapping in an attempt to get close enough to Saddler to steal his new Plagas sample.[20] Ada and Krauser are working with Albert Wesker (Richard Waugh), for whom both intend to secure a Plagas sample, though Krauser is suspicious of Ada.[21] Suspicious of the mercenary\\'s intentions, Saddler orders Krauser to kill Leon, believing that no matter which one dies, he will benefit.[22] After Krauser\\'s defeat, Leon rescues Ashley, and they remove the Plagas from their bodies using a specialized radiotherapeutic device. Leon confronts Saddler, and with Ada\\'s help, manages to kill him. However, Ada takes the sample from Leon at gunpoint before escaping in a helicopter,[23] leaving Leon and Ashley to escape via her Jet Ski as the island explodes.[24]\\n\\nDevelopment[edit]\\nIn 1999, producer Shinji Mikami said a Resident Evil sequel was in development for PlayStation 2.[25] Resident Evil 4 underwent a lengthy development, during which at least four versions of the game were discarded.[26] The first version was directed by Hideki Kamiya.[27] Around the turn of the millennium,[28] Resident Evil 2 writer Noboru Sugimura created a story for the game,[29] based on Kamiya\\'s idea to make a \"cool\" and \"stylish\" action game.[30] The story was based on unraveling the mystery surrounding the body of the protagonist, Tony,[31] an invincible man with skills and an intellect exceeding that of normal people, with his superhuman abilities explained with biotechnology.[28] As Kamiya felt the playable character did not look brave and heroic enough in battles from a fixed angle, he decided to drop the prerendered backgrounds from previous installments and use a dynamic camera system.[27] The team spent 11 days in the United Kingdom and Spain, photographing objects such as Gothic statues, bricks, and stone pavements for use in textures.[32][33]\\nThough the developers tried to make the \"coolness\" theme fit into the world of Resident Evil,[34] Mikami felt it strayed too far from the series\\' survival horror roots and gradually convinced the staff to make an independent game. This became a new Capcom franchise, Devil May Cry, released for the PlayStation 2 in August 2001.[35]\\n\\n\"Fog\" version[edit]\\nDevelopment on Resident Evil 4 restarted at the end of 2001.[36] The first announcement was made in November 2002, as one of five games developed exclusively for the GameCube by Capcom Production Studio 4, the Capcom Five.[37][38] This revision, commonly dubbed the \"fog version\", was directed by Hiroshi Shibata[39] and was 40 percent finished at that time.[40] The game saw Leon S. Kennedy struggling to survive[39] after having infiltrated Umbrella\\'s castle-like main headquarters located in Europe and featured traditional Resident Evil monsters such as zombies.[26][41][42] During the course of the new story which was again written by Sugimura\\'s scenario creation company Flagship,[43] Leon became infected with the Progenitor Virus and possessed a hidden power in his left hand.[26][44][45] The producer of the final version also pointed out that Ashley did not appear back then, though there was a different girl who was never revealed to the public.[26] The game was to feature some first-person elements.[46]\\n\\n\"Hook Man\" version[edit]\\nThis screenshot of a cancelled version depicts Leon fighting the hook man. Though this earlier revision still used fixed camera angles while exploring environments, the battles already employed the over-the-shoulder view seen in the final build.\\nAt E3 2003, Capcom showcased a version widely known as the \"hook man version\".[47] It was later titled Maboroshi no Biohazard 4 (幻の「バイオハザード4」; lit. \"The Phantom Biohazard 4\") on the Biohazard 4 Secret DVD. During Mikami\\'s introduction of the trailer, he assured that development was proceeding smoothly and claimed the game was scarier than ever before.[47] The story was set in a haunted building where Leon contracted a bizarre disease and fought paranormal enemies, such as animated suits of armor, living dolls, and a ghostlike man armed with a large hook.[41][47] The game had an otherworldly feel to it, containing elements like flashback and hallucinations that were marked by a bluish tint and a shaking camera.[26] It also displayed various gameplay mechanics that carried over to the final release, like the over-the-shoulder camera, a laser sight for aiming in battles and quick time events.[47] Other features, such as dialogue choices, were removed later.[26] Five minutes of gameplay footage were released on the Biohazard 4 Secret DVD, a Japanese pre-order bonus given out in January 2005.[48]\\n\\n\"Hallucination\" version[edit]\\nThe Hallucination version had only a basic story concept, having dropped the previous scenario penned by Noboru Sugimura of Flagship. In 2012, Resident Evil 3: Nemesis (1999) scenario writer Yasuhisa Kawamura said he was responsible for this version, as he wanted to make Biohazard 4 scarier \"and suggested using a particular scene from the American film Lost Souls (2000), where the main character [...] suddenly finds herself in a derelict building with a killer on the loose. An arranged version of this idea eventually turned into Hook Man. The idea went through several iterations as Mr. Sugimura and I carefully refined this world (which, I have to say, was very romantic). Leon infiltrates the castle of Spencer seeking the truth, while inside a laboratory located deep within, a young girl wakes up. Accompanied by a B.O.W. [an abbreviation for \"Bio Organic Weapon\" in the series\\' lore] dog, the two start to make their way up the castle. Unfortunately, there were many obstacles that needed to be overcome and the cost of development was deemed too expensive.\" Kawamura added he was very sorry and \"even ashamed\" that Mikami had to step in and scrap this version.[49] After this attempt, the last cancelled revision featured classic zombies again. However, it was discontinued after a few months, and before it was ever shown to the public, as the developers felt it was too formulaic.[26]\\nThe story of the Progenitor Virus was eventually covered in Resident Evil 5 (2009) and the Spencer Estate became the setting for Resident Evil 5\\'s downloadable content (DLC) pack \"Lost in Nightmares\" (featuring Chris Redfield and Jill Valentine).[50]\\n\\nFinal version[edit]\\nIt was decided to reinvent the series.[41] Mikami took over directorial duties from Shibata and began working on the version that was released.[51] In an interview with Game Informer, Mikami explained his decision to shift to a new gameplay system is due to the feeling that the older system is \"more of the same\" after playing Resident Evil Zero. He says that he only felt nervous once more when playing with the newer system.[52] Speaking for the team, game producer Hiroyuki Kobayashi[51] mentioned how the staff was \"tired of the same thing\"[53] and how some got bored and moved on to other projects.[54] In addition to that, the producer also felt that the older format was \"stuck in a cookie cutter mold\" and described it as \"shackles holding us down\".[55]\\nHowever, some of the staff members disagreed about changing the gameplay system. These members felt depressed and were hard to motivate after the game\\'s focus shifted to be more action-oriented.[36] Although Mikami demanded the camera system be revised, the team had reservations about making big changes to the series he had created.[56] Eventually, he intervened, explained his proposed changes, and wrote a new story that, unlike previous installments, was not centered on the company Umbrella.[56][57][58] Mikami wrote the entire story in just three weeks due to time constraints.[59] Inspired by Onimusha 3: Demon Siege (2004), a game Mikami had enjoyed playing but felt could have been better with a different view, he decided to place the camera behind the playable character.[60] To go along with the new gameplay and story, a new type of enemy called \"Ganado\" was created, as opposed to using the undead creatures from previous Resident Evil games.[58] Furthermore, producers expended additional detail to modify and update characters that had previously appeared in the series. In a documentary explaining the conception of the characters, Kamiya stated he intended to make Leon Kennedy \"look tougher, but also cool\".[61]\\nKobayashi was responsible for the design of some of the final game\\'s enemies, such as the Regenerators.[62] Kobayashi described the creatures\\' origins within universe lore as byproducts of Los Iluminados\\' research into bioorganic weapons, malformed creations implanted with multiple Plaga parasites during the experimentation process.[63] Regenerators are designed to take distinct heavy breaths before they are seen, which alerts the player to their presence. When encountered, often in small confined spaces, they would walk slowly towards the player character. The Regenerator is capable of continuously regenerating itself and cannot easily be dispatched unless the player is able to find the Plaga parasites within its body, which can only be seen with the infrared scope, and specifically target them first.[64][65][66][67] During an interview with Famitsu, Mikami explained that elements like the Regenerators help maintain the survival horror aspect of Resident Evil 4 as a balance between a \"scary kind of gameplay and the challenge of overcoming that fear\", with the goal of giving players a sense of achievement when they manage to overcome the monster.[68]\\nThe English voice actors recorded their parts in four sessions, over three to four months.[69] Capcom assigned Shinsaku Ohara as script translator and voice over coordinator.[70] Carolyn Lawrence, who provided the voice for Ashley Graham, described her character as \"vulnerable, because Leon has to come to her rescue all the time\".[69] She also described Kennedy\\'s character as \"more brawn, perhaps, than brain\".[69] In addition to the voice acting, the game\\'s designer detailed each cinematic sequence so that each character\\'s facial expressions matched the tone of their voice actor.[61]\\nAlong with Resident Evil: Dead Aim and Resident Evil Outbreak (both 2003), two side story games that did not fall under the exclusive policy, it was announced on October 31, 2004 that Resident Evil 4 would come to the PlayStation 2 in 2005, citing increased profit, changing market conditions, and increased consumer satisfaction as the key reasons. The PlayStation 2 version included new features, primarily a new sub-game featuring Ada Wong. On February 1, 2006, Ubisoft announced that they would be publishing the game on the PC for Windows.[71] On April 4, 2007, a Wii version was announced and was launched later in the year. The game features all of the extras in the PS2 version, along with other additions, including a trailer for Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles.[72][73]\\n\\nRelease[edit]\\nThe original version for the GameCube featured two different collector\\'s editions. The first was available as a pre-order that included the game, the Prologue art book, and a T-shirt. GameStop offered another limited edition that was packaged in a tin box with the art book, a cel of Leon, and a soundtrack CD.[74] Australia received an exclusive collector\\'s edition that came with the game and a bonus disc with interviews and creator\\'s footage.[75] Nintendo handled marketing sales and distribution of the title in Europe and Australia.[76]\\n\\nPorts[edit]\\nResident Evil 4 was ported to the PlayStation 2 after Capcom stated that it did not fall under the exclusivity deal with Nintendo. It was released in North America on October 25, 2005. The largest addition is \"Separate Ways\", a new scenario for Ada written by Haruo Murata.[70] According to producer Masachika Kawata, the Separate Ways campaign was something thought up by the PS2 porting team and was added after getting approval from Shinji Mikami.[77] The PlayStation 2 version featured two standard and collector\\'s bundles from pre-orders. The standard package included the game and a T-shirt, while the collector\\'s bundle also included a figurine of Leon, and the soundtrack Biohazard Sound Chronicle Best Track Box. This quickly sold out, and a second pressing was released that included an Ada figurine. Another, called the Resident Evil 4: Premium Edition, was packaged in a SteelBook media case, along with the art book, a documentary DVD, and a cel art of Ada.[78]\\nA PC port of Resident Evil 4 developed by Sourcenext was released in Hong Kong on February 1, 2007, published by Typhoon Games. It was released in Europe, North America, and Australia in March 2007 and was published by Ubisoft. The port contains the bonus features from the PS2 version, such as \"Separate Ways\", the P.R.L. 412 laser cannon and a second set of unlockable costumes for Leon and Ashley, as well as an Easy difficulty level. It also supports multiple widescreen resolutions.[79] The shadow and lighting problems were fixed in the only patch, Version 1.10.[80]\\nResident Evil 4: Wii Edition was released for the Wii on May 31, 2007 in Japan and on June 19, 2007 in the United States. It features updated controls that utilize the pointing and motion-sensing abilities of the Wii Remote and Nunchuk, though both the GameCube controller and the Classic Controller are also supported.[73] The Wii Remote is able to aim and shoot anywhere on the screen with a reticle that replaces the laser sight found in the other versions, and motion-based gestures are used to perform some context-sensitive actions, such as dodging or slashing. The Wii Edition also includes the extra content from the PS2 and PC versions, and a trailer for Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles.[72] The Wii Edition became available for download from the Wii U\\'s Nintendo eShop in Europe on October 29, 2015.[81][82]\\nResident Evil 4: Mobile Edition was released in Japan for au\\'s BREW 4.0 on February 1, 2008. It was announced by Capcom at TGS 2007.[83] Differences from the original include changing the flow of the story from being continuous to being divided into sections such as \"Village\", \"Ravine\", \"Fortress\" and \"Subterranean Tunnel\". There is also a more challenging Mercenary Mode.[84][85] The game uses the MascotCapsule eruption engine[86] and was adapted to the Zeebo and iOS platforms.[87][88] On July 13, 2009, without any formal announcement, Resident Evil 4: Mobile Edition was released by Capcom for the iOS platform via the App Store in Japan, but was quickly removed,[89][90] though some players were able to purchase and download it. The game has since been released in Japan and North America.[88] Later, Capcom made an update that had different difficulty levels and high scores. Capcom released a new separate version called Resident Evil 4 for Beginners, which offers the first two levels (three counting a training level) of both Story Mode and Mercenary Mode. However, the rest of the levels are available for purchase in-game as downloadable content. Due to the release of the iPad, Capcom recreated the iPhone version of Resident Evil 4: Mobile Edition and updated it to HD graphics as Resident Evil 4: iPad Edition.[91]\\nOn March 23, 2011, Capcom announced high-definition (HD) remastered versions of Resident Evil 4 and Resident Evil – Code: Veronica (2000) and Resident Evil 4 for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, as part of the Resident Evil: Revival Selection series.[92] The ports feature all the bonus content from the previous releases, including \"Separate Ways\". On July 23, 2011, Capcom announced at San Diego Comic-Con 2011 that Resident Evil 4 would be released on September 20[93] for the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Games on Demand.[94] In Japan, Resident Evil 4 and Resident Evil – Code: Veronica were released on a single disc as Biohazard Revival Selection on September 8, 2011.[95] In North America and Europe, the games were only released as downloads on Xbox Live Games on Demand and PlayStation Network.[96] On February 27, 2014, Capcom released Resident Evil 4 Ultimate HD Edition for Windows. The port features improved graphics and enhancements included in Resident Evil 4 HD. Resident Evil 4 was rereleased on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on August 30, 2016.[citation needed] In April 2013, Resident Evil 4 was released on Android. Outside of Japan, it is exclusive to Samsung through their Galaxy Store.[97] Capcom announced in October 2018 that Resident Evil 4 would be published for the Nintendo Switch in 2019, along with releases of Resident Evil and Resident Evil Zero (both 2002).[98]\\nIn October 2021, Capcom released a virtual reality (VR) version of Resident Evil 4 for the Oculus Quest 2. Developed by the American Armature Studio,[99] many elements of gameplay like combat and inventory management were changed to accommodate VR.[100] This version, which runs on Unreal Engine 4, also includes redesigned textures with increased resolution.[100] The developers and executive producer Tom Ivey stated that there were changes made to \"update the game for a modern audience\", and a number of in-game animations (such as the animation triggered when players attempted to look up Ashley\\'s skirt), dialogue and flirtatious banter between characters were removed.[101][102][103]\\n\\nMerchandise[edit]\\nBiohazard 4 Original Soundtrack was released in Japan on December 22, 2005. It contains 62 compositions from the game and the 48-page Visual Booklet with liner notes from composers Shusaku Uchiyama and Misao Senbongi.[104] Other merchandise included figures by McFarlane Toys,[105][106] NECA[107] and Hot Toys.[108] Agatsuma Entertainment has also created various miniature collectibles based on several main characters and enemies from Resident Evil 4.[109] Two special controllers designed to resemble chainsaws were designed by NubyTech for use with the GameCube and PlayStation 2 versions.[110]\\n\\nReception[edit]\\nReviews[edit]\\nReceptionAggregate scoreAggregatorScoreMetacriticNGC: 96/100[111]PC: 76/100[112]PC (Ultimate HD Edition): 79/100[113]PS2: 96/100[114]PS3: 84/100[115]Wii: 91/100[116]X360: 84/100[117]Review scoresPublicationScore1Up.comNGC: A[118]PC: A[119]Wii: B+[120]EdgeNGC: 9/10[121]FamitsuWii: 38/40[122]GameSpotNGC: 9.6/10[123]PC: 7.8/10[124]PS2: 9.3/10[125]Wii: 9.1/10[126]GameSpyNGC: 5/5[127]PC: 3.5/5[128]PS2: 5/5[129]Wii: 5/5[130]IGNNGC: 9.8/10[131]PC: 7.7/10[132]PS2: 9.5/10[133]PS3: 8.5/10[134]Wii: 9/10[135]Nintendo PowerNGC: 10/10[136]Official Xbox Magazine (US)X360: 9/10[137]PC Gamer (US)PC: 85/100[138]\\nThe GameCube and PlayStation 2 versions of Resident Evil 4 have a score of 96/100 on Metacritic, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[111][114] These versions have the top ranking on Metacritic\\'s list of the Best Video Games for 2005.[139] In addition to the gameplay, the characters and story received positive commentary, leading to the finished product being deemed by most as one of the best video games ever made. GameSpot\\'s Greg Kasavin praised the voice acting, but claimed that it was betrayed by \"some uncharacteristically goofy dialogue\".[123] Yahoo! Games\\' Adam Pavlacka and GameSpot\\'s Kevin VanOrd acclaimed Capcom for adding great amounts of detail to the characters.[126][140] IGN\\'s Matt Casamassina went into further detail in his review for Resident Evil 4, praising not only the detailed character design but also the fight choreography and three-dimensional modeling within cinematic sequences.[131] Casamassina also complimented the voice actors, especially Paul Mercier (Leon), commenting, \"For once, the characters are believable because Capcom has hired competent actors to supply their voices. Leon in particular is very well produced\".[131] IGN and Nintendo Power specifically recognized Resident Evil 4\\'s character design and voice acting. The increased variety of weapons has been praised by gaming publications such as GamePro[141] and Game Over Online.[142] G4 television program X-Play gave it a 5 out of 5, for introducing a new style of gameplay for the series as well as incorporating moments where the player would have to interact with the cut scenes. Not long after, it was awarded as the best game ever reviewed on the show.[143] The makers of Resident Evil 4 worked on various innovations associated with the use and inventory of weapons.[144] Game Over stated that players can use the vast array of weapons to \"go for headshots now\".[142] Game Informer stated that ammunition is more plentiful in Resident Evil 4 than in other games in the series, making it more action-oriented.[145]\\nThe ratings of the PC port, along with the Ultimate HD Edition release, were not as high as for the other versions. The original PC port was criticized for no mouse support and frustrating keyboard controls, low-quality FMV cutscenes, and choppy lightning graphics rendering. Despite these problems, it received generally positive reviews from critics,[112] including IGN and GameSpot, which praised the gameplay, character models and environments, and sound design.[124][132] GameRevolution referred to the game\\'s Ultimate HD Edition as \"a bare-bones port of a nonetheless spectacular game\", noting \"minor superficial alterations\" similar to the 2007 PC port and asserting that the true \"Ultimate Edition\" of Resident Evil 4 is the Wii version.[146] Japanese game magazine Famitsu reviewed the Wii version, with two editors giving it a perfect 10 score, and the remaining pair giving it a 9, resulting in a score of 38 out of 40. The reviewers felt that the new controls offer something fresh. Multiple reviewers agreed that even those who own the original will find something fun and enjoyable in this version.[122] British magazine NGamer gave the Wii Edition a score of 96%,[116] slightly lower than the 97% given to the GameCube version. They praised the visuals, controls, and features and commented on the fact that such an \"exceptional package\" was on sale for a low price; however, when writing about the Wii controls, they said, \"if you\\'ve played the GC version this won\\'t be as special\". Official Nintendo Magazine gave the Wii version 94%, 3% less than the original due to it simply not having the same impact it did back then.[147] In 2009, they went on to place the game 9th on a list of the greatest Nintendo games of all time.[148] IGN praised the Wii version, stating it is the superior edition, but does not push the Wii like it did with GameCube and PS2.[135] GameSpot praised the new controls of the Wii Edition but commented on the lack of exclusive Wii features.[126] Hyper\\'s Jonti Davies commended Resident Evil 4: Wii Edition for its \"visual improvements\" but criticized it for having \"no new content\".[149] The PS3 version of Resident Evil 4 HD received a score of 9.0 from Destructoid, which called it \"a hallmark of excellence\".[150] In their October 2013 issue, Edge retroactively awarded it ten out of ten.[151]\\n\\nAwards[edit]\\nResident Evil 4 was named Game of the Year by multiple publications, including Edge,[152] Electronic Gaming Monthly,[153] GameTrailers,[154] Game Informer,[155] GamePro, GameRevolution, the Chicago Tribune, and the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. The game was also included in lists of the best games of 2005 by various media outlets, including Play, the Associated Press, Universal Press Syndicate, The Mercury News, Maxim, Sound & Vision, The News Tribune, the Hartford Courant, and The Oregonian.[156] GameSpy labeled it the GameCube Game of the Year,[157] the second PlayStation 2 Game of the Year (behind God of War)[158] and the second Game of the Year (behind Civilization IV).[159] PlayStation Magazine also labeled it the second Game of the Year, in addition to Best Graphics and Most Improved Sequel.[160] At the GameSpot\\'s Best of 2005 Awards, Resident Evil 4 was chosen Game of the Year,[161] Best GameCube Game,[162] Best Action Adventure Game,[163] and Most Improved Sequel.[164] It won Game of the Year, Best Action Game, Best Graphics Technology, Best Artistic Design, Best Original Score, and Best Use of Sound in the GameCube division of IGN\\'s The Best of 2005 Awards,[165] where it also won Overall – Best Graphics Technology award,[166] as well as being a runner-up in the Overall – Game of the Year and Overall – Best Action Game categories.[167][168] The game was 1UP Awards\\' Game of the Year and Best Action Game winner.[169] It went on to win Game of the Year 2005,[170] Best Horror Game of the Year 2005,[171] GameCube Game of the Year 2005,[172] and GameCube Action Game of the Year 2005 awards,[173] and was a runner-up in PlayStation 2 Game of the Year 2005[174] and PlayStation 2 Action Game of the Year 2005 classifications[175] at GameZone\\'s Game of the Year Awards. Nintendo Power awarded Resident Evil 4 Game of the Year, Best Adventure Game, Game of the Year – GameCube, Best Graphics – GameCube, Best Sound / Voice Acting at its awards show.[176] During the Nintendojo\\'s Best of 2005 Awards, the game received recognition as the runner-up for Best Gameplay Innovation[177] and Most Engrossing Game.[178] Additionally, it emerged victorious in the categories of Best Game, Period.,[179] Best GameCube Visuals, Best GameCube Gameplay, and Best GameCube Overall.[180] At the PALGN Awards, the game achieved success by securing the titles of Action Game of the Year for 2005 and GameCube Game of the Year for 2005, while also attaining the title of Overall Game of the Year for 2005. In the category of PlayStation 2 Game of the Year for 2005, the game earned the recognition of a runner-up position.[181]\\nThe virtual reality port of Resident Evil 4 was named VR/AR Game of the Year at The Game Awards 2021,[182] and was also named XR Game of the Year at the SXSW Gaming Awards.[183] At the 11th New York Game Awards, the game won Best AR/VR Game and Best Remake.[184] Resident Evil 4 VR was nominated for Immersive Reality Game of the Year and Immersive Reality Technical Achievement at the 25th Annual D.I.C.E.

The European release sold its entire 200,000 copies during the first month. By December 2005, 3 million copies of the GameCube and PlayStation 2 versions had been shipped worldwide.[203][204] According to January 17, 2007 sales figures provided by Capcom, the GameCube version of Resident Evil 4 had sold a total of 1.6 million copies worldwide, while the PS2 version had sold over 2 million copies.[205] As of March 2025, Resident Evil 4 had sold 14.7 million copies.[206] It holds the record for \"Best-Selling Survival Horror Game\" in the 2012 Guinness World Records Gamer\\'s Edition.[207]\\n\\nLegacy[edit]\\nResident Evil 4 is considered one of the best video games of all time. It is included in the reference book 1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die (2014).[208] Nintendo Power ranked it as number one in their list of the top 25 best GameCube games of all time in 2005[136] and also ranked it second on their list of the best games of the 2000s in 2010.[209] In 2008, Resident Evil 4 was ranked first place in the list of the best video games of all time according to the readers of IGN,[210] and sixth place in the list of the best PlayStation 2 games of all time according to the IGN staff.[211] In 2021, IGN ranked the game as the 40th best game of all time.[212] In 2009, Game Informer ranked Resident Evil 4 number one on their list of top GameCube games[213] and number three on their list of top PlayStation 2 games.[214] In 2022, Complex magazine named it the tenth-best PlayStation 2 game of all time.[215] GamePro ranked it as the second best game for the PS2.[216] In 2010, the readers of PlayStation Official Magazine voted it the 10th greatest PlayStation game.[217] In 2007, Edge ranked the game at second place in its list of top games of all time, behind only The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time (1998).[218] That same year, G4 named it the 21st top video game of all time, calling it \"a modern horror masterpiece.\"[219] In 2015, it placed 7th on USgamer\\'s The 15 Best Games Since 2000 list.[220] In early 2006, in their 200th issue, Nintendo Power ranked it in second place in their Top 200 Games of all-time list, also behind only The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time.[221] In 2025, Rolling Stone named it the 27th-greatest game.[222]\\nResident Evil 4 is regarded as one of the most influential games of the 2000s, particularly due to its influence in redefining the third-person shooter genre[223] by introducing offset camera angles that do not obscure action.[224] The new gameplay alterations and immersive style appealed to many not previously familiar with the series.[225] The over-the-shoulder viewpoint introduced in Resident Evil 4 has later become standard in third-person shooters and action games, including titles ranging from Gears of War to Batman: Arkham Asylum (2009).[223] It has also become a standard \"precision aim\" feature for third-person action games in general, with examples including Dead Space, Grand Theft Auto, Ratchet & Clank, Fallout,[226] Uncharted, Mass Effect and The Last of Us.[227] In 2019, Game Informer called Resident Evil 4 \"the most important third-person shooter ever\" and said it \"innovated two genres\", inspiring developers of both survival horror and shooter games.[228]\\nResident Evil 4 redefined the survival horror genre by emphasizing reflexes and precision aiming,[229] thus broadening the gameplay of the series with elements from the wider action game genre.[230] However, this also led some reviewers to suggest that the Resident Evil series had abandoned the survival horror genre,[231][232] by demolishing the genre conventions that it had established.[233] Other major survival horror series followed suit, by developing their combat systems to feature more action, such as Silent Hill: Homecoming[231] and the 2008 version of Alone in the Dark.[234] These changes represent an overall trend among console games shifting towards visceral action gameplay.[235]\\nWhile working on The Last of Us, Naughty Dog took cues from Resident Evil 4, particularly the tension and action.[236] Dead Space designers Ben Wanat and Wright Bagwell stated that their game was originally intended to be System Shock 3 before the release of Resident Evil 4 inspired them to go back to the drawing board.[237] BioShock (2007) was also influenced by Resident Evil 4, including its approach to the environments, combat, and tools, its game design and tactical elements, its \"gameplay fuelled storytelling\" and inventory system, and its opening village level in terms of how it \"handled the sandbox nature of the combat\" and in terms of \"the environment.\"[238] Cory Barlog cited Resident Evil 4 as an influence on the God of War series, including God of War II (2007) and particularly God of War (2018), which was influenced by Resident Evil 4\\'s \"combination of poised camera exploration and scavenging\".[239] Uncharted director Bruce Straley called the Resident Evil 4 village sequence the best opening fight in a video game.[240]\\nResident Evil Village (2021) was influenced by Resident Evil 4. The director said, \"If Resident Evil 7 was like a reboot that inherited the DNA of the original Resident Evil, then you could say that this time we\\'re doing the same for Resident Evil 4. We\\'ve designed the game and its structure with Resident Evil 4\\'s essence in mind\".[241]\\nVentureBeat credits Resident Evil 4 HD as an early example of HD video game remasters.[227] A remake of Resident Evil 4 was released on March 24, 2023 on the PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, and the Xbox Series X and Series S.[1][242] The remake was also announced for the iPhone 15 Pro, to be released between late 2023 to early 2024.[243]\\nIn June 2021, the photographer and author Judy Juracek launched legal proceedings against Capcom for allegedly using images from her book Surfaces: Visual Research for Artists, Architects, and Designers (1996) without her permission to create textures for multiple games, including Resident Evil 4 and Devil May Cry.[244][245] The parties reached an undisclosed settlement outside of court in February 2022.[246] Capcom and Juracek have amicably resolved their dispute concerning the alleged use of her photos in Capcom\\'s games. A dismissal was filed on February 7, 2022 with the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut to end the lawsuit.[247]\\n\\nNotes[edit]\\n\\n\\n^ Original Windows version developed by Sourcenext; Oculus Quest 2 version developed by Armature Studio.\\n\\n^ Known in Japan as Biohazard 4 (Japanese: バイオハザード4, Hepburn: Baiohazādo 4)\\n\\n^ Shared with Kingdom Hearts II\\n\\n\\nReferences[edit]\\n\\n\\n^ a b McWhertor, Michael (June 2, 2022). \"Resident Evil 4 remake announced, coming March 2023\".

Numerous\\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional\\ncomputation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2\\nBackground\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [12]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\\n3\\nModel Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., xn) to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z = (z1, ..., zn). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1, ..., ym) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\n2\\nFigure 1: The Transformer - model architecture.\\nThe Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully\\nconnected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1,\\nrespectively.\\n3.1\\nEncoder and Decoder Stacks\\nEncoder:\\nThe encoder is composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. Each layer has two\\nsub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\\nwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of\\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\\nLayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer\\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.\\nDecoder:\\nThe decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. In addition to the two\\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\\npredictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\\n3.2\\nAttention\\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum\\n3\\nScaled Dot-Product Attention\\nMulti-Head Attention\\nFigure 2: (left) Scaled Dot-Product Attention. (right) Multi-Head Attention consists of several\\nattention layers running in parallel.\\nof the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the\\nquery with the corresponding key.\\n3.2.1\\nScaled Dot-Product Attention\\nWe call our particular attention \"Scaled Dot-Product Attention\" (Figure 2). The input consists of\\nqueries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the\\nquery with all keys, divide each by √dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the\\nvalues.\\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together\\ninto a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices K and V . We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention(Q, K, V ) = softmax(QKT\\n√dk\\n)V\\n(1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\\nof\\n1\\n√dk . Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of\\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\\nextremely small gradients 4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by\\n1\\n√dk .\\n3.2.2\\nMulti-Head Attention\\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\\nwe found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values h times with different, learned\\nlinear projections to dk, dk and dv dimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of\\nqueries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding dv-dimensional\\n4To illustrate why the dot products get large, assume that the components of q and k are independent random\\nvariables with mean 0 and variance 1. Then their dot product, q · k = Pdk\\ni=1 qiki, has mean 0 and variance dk.\\n4\\noutput values. These are concatenated and once again projected, resulting in the final values, as\\ndepicted in Figure 2.\\nMulti-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation\\nsubspaces at different positions. With a single attention head, averaging inhibits this.\\nMultiHead(Q, K, V ) = Concat(head1, ..., headh)W O\\nwhere headi = Attention(QW Q\\ni , KW K\\ni , V W V\\ni )\\nWhere the projections are parameter matrices W Q\\ni\\n∈Rdmodel×dk, W K\\ni\\n∈Rdmodel×dk, W V\\ni\\n∈Rdmodel×dv\\nand W O ∈Rhdv×dmodel.\\nIn this work we employ h = 8 parallel attention layers, or heads. For each of these we use\\ndk = dv = dmodel/h = 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3\\nApplications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[38, 2, 9].\\n• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3\\nPosition-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN(x) = max(0, xW1 + b1)W2 + b2\\n(2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff = 2048.\\n3.4\\nEmbeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √dmodel.\\n5\\nTable 1: Maximum path lengths, per-layer complexity and minimum number of sequential operations\\nfor different layer types. n is the sequence length, d is the representation dimension, k is the kernel\\nsize of convolutions and r the size of the neighborhood in restricted self-attention.\\nLayer Type\\nComplexity per Layer\\nSequential\\nMaximum Path Length\\nOperations\\nSelf-Attention\\nO(n2 · d)\\nO(1)\\nO(1)\\nRecurrent\\nO(n · d2)\\nO(n)\\nO(n)\\nConvolutional\\nO(k · n · d2)\\nO(1)\\nO(logk(n))\\nSelf-Attention (restricted)\\nO(r · n · d)\\nO(1)\\nO(n/r)\\n3.5\\nPositional Encoding\\nSince our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the\\norder of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the\\ntokens in the sequence. To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\nbottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\\nas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\\nlearned and fixed [9].\\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\\nPE(pos,2i) = sin(pos/100002i/dmodel)\\nPE(pos,2i+1) = cos(pos/100002i/dmodel)\\nwhere pos is the position and i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2π to 10000 · 2π. We\\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\\nrelative positions, since for any fixed offset k, PEpos+k can be represented as a linear function of\\nPEpos.\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two\\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4\\nWhy Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1, ..., xn) to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., zn), with xi, zi ∈Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations. In terms of\\ncomputational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\\n6\\nlength n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with\\nsentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece\\n[38] and byte-pair [31] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving\\nvery long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r in\\nthe input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum\\npath length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output\\npositions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\\nor O(logk(n)) in the case of dilated convolutions [18], increasing the length of the longest paths\\nbetween any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [6], however, decrease the complexity\\nconsiderably, to O(k · n · d + n · d2). Even with k = n, however, the complexity of a separable\\nconvolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\\nthe approach we take in our model.\\nAs side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions\\nfrom our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention\\nheads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic\\nand semantic structure of the sentences.\\n5\\nTraining\\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\\n5.1\\nTraining Data and Batching\\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million\\nsentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [3], which has a shared source-\\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\\nvocabulary [38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\\ntarget tokens.\\n5.2\\nHardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the\\nbottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps\\n(3.5 days).\\n5.3\\nOptimizer\\nWe used the Adam optimizer [20] with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.98 and ϵ = 10−9. We varied the learning\\nrate over the course of training, according to the formula:\\nlrate = d−0.5\\nmodel · min(step_num−0.5, step_num · warmup_steps−1.5)\\n(3)\\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the first warmup_steps training steps,\\nand decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used\\nwarmup_steps = 4000.\\n5.4\\nRegularization\\nWe employ three types of regularization during training:\\n7\\nTable 2: The Transformer achieves better BLEU scores than previous state-of-the-art models on the\\nEnglish-to-German and English-to-French newstest2014 tests at a fraction of the training cost.\\nModel\\nBLEU\\nTraining Cost (FLOPs)\\nEN-DE\\nEN-FR\\nEN-DE\\nEN-FR\\nByteNet [18]\\n23.75\\nDeep-Att + PosUnk [39]\\n39.2\\n1.0 · 1020\\nGNMT + RL [38]\\n24.6\\n39.92\\n2.3 · 1019\\n1.4 · 1020\\nConvS2S [9]\\n25.16\\n40.46\\n9.6 · 1018\\n1.5 · 1020\\nMoE [32]\\n26.03\\n40.56\\n2.0 · 1019\\n1.2 · 1020\\nDeep-Att + PosUnk Ensemble [39]\\n40.4\\n8.0 · 1020\\nGNMT + RL Ensemble [38]\\n26.30\\n41.16\\n1.8 · 1020\\n1.1 · 1021\\nConvS2S Ensemble [9]\\n26.36\\n41.29\\n7.7 · 1019\\n1.2 · 1021\\nTransformer (base model)\\n27.3\\n38.1\\n3.3 · 1018\\nTransformer (big)\\n28.4\\n41.8\\n2.3 · 1019\\nResidual Dropout\\nWe apply dropout [33] to the output of each sub-layer, before it is added to the\\nsub-layer input and normalized. In addition, we apply dropout to the sums of the embeddings and the\\npositional encodings in both the encoder and decoder stacks. For the base model, we use a rate of\\nPdrop = 0.1.\\nLabel Smoothing\\nDuring training, we employed label smoothing of value ϵls = 0.1 [36]. This\\nhurts perplexity, as the model learns to be more unsure, but improves accuracy and BLEU score.\\n6\\nResults\\n6.1\\nMachine Translation\\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, the big transformer model (Transformer (big)\\nin Table 2) outperforms the best previously reported models (including ensembles) by more than 2.0\\nBLEU, establishing a new state-of-the-art BLEU score of 28.4. The configuration of this model is\\nlisted in the bottom line of Table 3. Training took 3.5 days on 8 P100 GPUs. Even our base model\\nsurpasses all previously published models and ensembles, at a fraction of the training cost of any of\\nthe competitive models.\\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our big model achieves a BLEU score of 41.0,\\noutperforming all of the previously published single models, at less than 1/4 the training cost of the\\nprevious state-of-the-art model. The Transformer (big) model trained for English-to-French used\\ndropout rate Pdrop = 0.1, instead of 0.3.\\nFor the base models, we used a single model obtained by averaging the last 5 checkpoints, which\\nwere written at 10-minute intervals. For the big models, we averaged the last 20 checkpoints. We\\nused beam search with a beam size of 4 and length penalty α = 0.6 [38]. These hyperparameters\\nwere chosen after experimentation on the development set. We set the maximum output length during\\ninference to input length + 50, but terminate early when possible [38].\\nTable 2 summarizes our results and compares our translation quality and training costs to other model\\narchitectures from the literature.

We used beam search as described in the previous section, but no\\ncheckpoint averaging. We present these results in Table 3.\\nIn Table 3 rows (A), we vary the number of attention heads and the attention key and value dimensions,\\nkeeping the amount of computation constant, as described in Section 3.2.2. While single-head\\nattention is 0.9 BLEU worse than the best setting, quality also drops off with too many heads.\\nIn Table 3 rows (B), we observe that reducing the attention key size dk hurts model quality. This\\nsuggests that determining compatibility is not easy and that a more sophisticated compatibility\\nfunction than dot product may be beneficial. We further observe in rows (C) and (D) that, as expected,\\nbigger models are better, and dropout is very helpful in avoiding over-fitting. In row (E) we replace our\\nsinusoidal positional encoding with learned positional embeddings [9], and observe nearly identical\\nresults to the base model.\\n6.3\\nEnglish Constituency Parsing\\nTo evaluate if the Transformer can generalize to other tasks we performed experiments on English\\nconstituency parsing. This task presents specific challenges: the output is subject to strong structural\\nconstraints and is significantly longer than the input. Furthermore, RNN sequence-to-sequence\\nmodels have not been able to attain state-of-the-art results in small-data regimes [37].\\nWe trained a 4-layer transformer with dmodel = 1024 on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) portion of the\\nPenn Treebank [25], about 40K training sentences. We also trained it in a semi-supervised setting,\\nusing the larger high-confidence and BerkleyParser corpora from with approximately 17M sentences\\n[37]. We used a vocabulary of 16K tokens for the WSJ only setting and a vocabulary of 32K tokens\\nfor the semi-supervised setting.\\nWe performed only a small number of experiments to select the dropout, both attention and residual\\n(section 5.4), learning rates and beam size on the Section 22 development set, all other parameters\\nremained unchanged from the English-to-German base translation model.

On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014\\nEnglish-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best\\nmodel outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We\\nplan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and\\nto investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs\\nsuch as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/\\ntensorflow/tensor2tensor.\\nAcknowledgements\\nWe are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for their fruitful\\ncomments, corrections and inspiration.\\nReferences\\n[1] Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.
